# Connecting a Database Using Google Sheets

## Load the Spreadsheet Data in Your JavaScript

Add the following to your `code.js` file inside the `setup()` function. You can place it at the top.

```javascript
chatbot.loadDB('1rR9ODzcTYv95dYGal-ZXBRp3wgp0I7fbKIk5I2hJkgI');
```

You will need to change the `key` value to the link provided by your Google sheet.
