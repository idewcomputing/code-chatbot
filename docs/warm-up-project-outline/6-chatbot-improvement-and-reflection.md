# 6 Chatbot Improvement and Reflection

## Objective

Implement changes to your chatbot based on the previous evaluation and reflect on the key principles of chatbot design.

## Instructions

**1. Incorporate Improvements in your Chatbot** Based on your feedback in the previous activity, update your chatbot script and test it to ensure it works as expected.

**2. Reflect on Key Learning** Now that you have completed your first basic chatbot, reflect on the key aspects of building a successful chatbot. Create a document and write what you have learned in the following three areas of chatbot design, as if you were advising people on how to develop their own chatbot.

* **Chatbot Purpose:** What are important ideas to keep in mind when developing the chatbot's purpose and the problem to be solved?
* **Chatbot Personality:** What are key things to consider when determining a chatbot personality and why are they important? Provide some example dialogue between the user and chatbot to help explain your ideas.
* **Chatbot Scripting and Code:** What did you find challenging, but very important, when creating the actual script/code for the chatbot? How do you think these challenges will affect a larger chatbot project that will have more complexity and features?
