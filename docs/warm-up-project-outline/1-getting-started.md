# 1 Code Template

## Objective

Investigate the basic use and logic of a chatbot script and make modifications to demonstrate initial understanding.

## Instructions

Before we get into the details of designing chatbot conversations, we want to practice how you will technically build them with code. Understand that machines and their programs are still rather "dumb" compared to humans and cannot interpret complex human ideas easily. So your challenge will be to connect a person's complex intentions to a rather simplistic computer program.

Let's get started with some chatbot code.

1. Go to the [Getting Started](../core-template.md) and copy the template code for each file and ensure that it works.
2. Take a look at the `bot.rive` file while you message with the chatbot. Notice how the script file controls how the bot responds to you.
3. Change the `start` response, which introduces your chatbot to the user. Include a name for your chatbot. You can change it again later.
4. Change the `*` response as well, where the bot responds to unknown user requests.
5. Add the following _Rivescript_ lines below to respond to "hello" and "bye". Change the response as you like.

```text
+ hello
- Hi there. Thanks for visiting.

+ bye
- Good bye.
```

## âœ“ Deliverable

Demonstrate a working Chatbot.
