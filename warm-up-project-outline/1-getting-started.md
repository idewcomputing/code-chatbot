# 1 Getting Started

## Objective

Investigate the basic use and logic of a chatbot script and make modifications to demonstrate initial understanding.

## Instructions

Before we get into how to carefully design chatbot conversations, we want to practice how you will technically build them with code. It is good to experience this fact -- that machines and their programs are still rather "dumb" compared to humans and cannot interpret complex human ideas easily. So a challenge will be to thoughtfully map the intended meaning of people to a rather simplistic computer program.

Let's get started with some chatbot code and share your chatbot for the world to see through the iDEW chatbot.

1. Go to the [Chatbot code template](https://codepen.io/jlyst/project/editor/ZqdVNx/) on CodePen and fork it to make your own CodePen Project.
2. Take a look at the `chatbotRiveScript.html` file while you message with the chatbot. Notice how the script file controls how the it responds to you.
3. Change the `start` response, which introduces your chatbot to the user. Include a name for your chatbot. You can change it again later.
4. Change the `hello` response as well.
5. Complete [this Google form \(Titled: Chatbot Scripts\)](https://goo.gl/forms/ZgVAUlKL8wCVb2zE3). Provide a name for your chatbot and paste the text of your `chatbotRiveScript.html` file as your script. This will make your chatbot available to the [iDEW chatbot](https://3f4f14cf84904c39b800c0f021944c18.codepen.website/), allowing anyone to interact with yours.

## âœ“ Deliverable

Check that you can access your chatbot from the [iDEW chatbot](https://3f4f14cf84904c39b800c0f021944c18.codepen.website/).

Whew, we said "chatbot" a lot!

Later, as you make changes to your script, you will be able to update it using the [Chatbot Scripts Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/ZgVAUlKL8wCVb2zE3) again.
